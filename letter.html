                        Hello! First of all I want to thank you for your time. I'm very pleased that you visit my small site-resume and pay attention to my person. OK, let me introduce myself, it should not take much of your time.
                        <p>
                        This text, this site and all examples were made during one week when I got some free time. There are no any 'tempaltes' or frases from search engines. Everythign is 'as it is', in the real time. I'm sorry for some mistakes that you can find here, english is not my native language. Thank you for you patience.
                        <p>
                        I'm 38 years old. I was born in Minsk. I got higher education in 2005 but have never used it for work. Every time I changed my workplace I got some kind of test period and improved my skills myself (self-education). I haven't been working in IT for the last 3 years but now I want to continue my job in this sphere. I'm familiar with PHP/Mysql (I used it to make parsers to locate information from different business networks. Curl, cron ... etc). I understand how javascript and css works and can start working with simple pages and animations. I have expereinse in building and managing small business sites, such as transportation, bueing, selling and so on. I worked with git, cPanel, smtp, ftp, teams ... and other office programs.
                        <p>
                        I'm responsible and motivated person. I'm ready to start from any level with ability to develop my skills.
